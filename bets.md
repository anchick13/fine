# FiNeBets

The idea of social betting is to employ multiple brains in making a certain financial decision and weight such decision based on financial contribution.

If you get a large enough crowd participating, this process could become a statistically weighted decision.

For the time being idea is to only invite FiNePPL, as trusted group of financial enthusiasts.

## rules

###  what defines a FiNe bet

- decision to buy commodity at a given time.
- exit criteria to sell a commodity.
- decision making point for the participant of the bet.
- motivation for such bet.

### betting process and execution

- you decide to participate buy __"call"__ on the bet.
- when you "call", you need to decide how much money you're ready to spend on the bet. should be divisible by the cost of the bet.
- after you "call", you'll see the __"ratio"__ of your bet. E.g _0.01_ would mean, that your bet amount constitutes _1%_ of the total bet amount.
- after the "call", you can __"raise"__ your bet once.
- all "calls" and "raises" done blindly and simultaneously to not influence each other.
- we can see/discuss "calls" before "raises".
- after "raises" we physically buy the commodity.
- if no exit criteria was met for any part of the commodity => this bet is lost => everyone loses their money.
- if we exited from a bet => money is spread between participants based on "ratios" after "raises".
- all data is recorded for accumulation.

### list of commodities

List of companies is short and restricted to overlap with data gathering from sentiment analysis in the future (but we can decide to change/extend it): https://bitbucket.org/fineppl/fine/src/master/#markdown-header-prioritized-commodities

### game night

- while we don't have technical support for this project, lets try to organize FiNePPL, who are interested in this project for a game night.
- we can prepare all bets here for a given game night and ppl would call/raise on them during the gathering.
- the best way to execute those bets is via Robinhood. We can use _romanov_'s acc for the time being, with a premise that bet participants agree to compensate for for income tax at the end of the year for their gains through betting (be aware of the top income bracket).

## questions

- what are the legal implications of all that?
- is it better to use IRA account to avoid taxes? can you trade options on IRA?
