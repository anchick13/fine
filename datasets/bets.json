    - all those stocks tend to react to earning calls. by buying 2w before and selling 2w after earning data -> you can utilize this reaction if you make the right call
    - six instead of one to diversify the risk.
    - all those companies report during the same week. so that allows to make the bet as a single event in time and diversify the risk.
    - i did it ones for 1K$, but i think that spread could have been bought with half the price -> so that's where 500$ come from.",
