FiNePPL (aka this group) was created as a trial for an idea, that FiNePPL can make better financial decisions together.

## goals

- Help educate FiNePPL around latest financial tools and mechanisms.
- Help FiNePPL reach their personal financial goals.
- Grow FiNePPL.

## rules

  - **equality.** we treat members with respect and as equals.
    - _when 50%+1 members of the group agree and every group member is aware of the decision, they can add new members to the group_
    - _when 100% members of the group agree, they can change this README_
    - _when 100%-1 members of the group agree on termination decision, they can terminate the one who disagrees_
- **contribute.** everyone needs to contribute in order to benefit.
    - _termination after 1 month with no contributions to FiNe_
- **security.** keep artifacts of FiNe private and secure.
    - _termination, if violation was done consciously_
- **privacy.** FiNePPL is a private group, shouldn't be discussed outside of FiNe (except with direct family members).
    - _immediate termination_
