FiNe is a financial education game, that allow people to learn about various financial instruments they have available to them at no price. Those instruments may include: *Bank Accounts*, *Investment*, *Credit*, *Loans*.

The first MVP version would concentrate on *Investment*

You'd get a basic bank account to which you receive a weekly direct deposit of 10K Coins.
You can spend them buying various stocks, etfs, etc to form your portfolio. We can expand into options, margins, etc in the future.
This portfolio would simulate real market behavior. So first education you'd get is a free exposure to the market and ability to check your hypothesis about it.
We would also build a set recommenders that would educate people to think about various techniques they can use to invest:
