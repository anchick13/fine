FiNePPL (aka this group) was created as a trial for an idea, that FiNePPL can make better financial decisions together.

## goals

- Help educate FiNePPL around latest financial tools and mechanisms.
- Help FiNePPL reach their personal financial goals.
- Grow FiNePPL.

## rules

  - **equality.** we treat members with respect and as equals.
    - _when 50%+1 members of the group agree and every group member is aware of the decision, they can add new members to the group_
    - _when 100% members of the group agree, they can change this README_
    - _when 100%-1 members of the group agree on termination decision, they can terminate the one who disagrees_
- **contribute.** everyone needs to contribute in order to benefit.
    - _termination after 1 month with no contributions to FiNe_
- **security.** keep artifacts of FiNe private and secure.
    - _termination, if violation was done consciously_
- **privacy.** FiNePPL is a private group, shouldn't be discussed outside of FiNe (except with direct family members).
    - _immediate termination_

## ideas

### stock decisions tracking

- active bets: https://bitbucket.org/fineppl/fine-bets/src/master/active-bets
- archived bets : https://bitbucket.org/fineppl/fine-bets/src/master/archive
- pending: - active bets: https://bitbucket.org/fineppl/fine-bets/src/master/gn.md

### signal aggregation across projects

if trading decision of various projects tracked in the same data format, like

```
- project id
- financial commodity id
- timestamp
- decision sell / buy
- confidence level
```

we can train a statistical model, that would assign weights to specific FiNe projects.
and would be making a aggregated sell/buy decision, when overall model confidence reaches predetermined threshold.

they you give this model a certain budget a let it trade.
goal for the model could be to beat SP500 for a given month.

trading data that model produces can be also re-annotated and fed back to the training set.
